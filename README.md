# latte

**latte** is a small, terminal-based task tracker focused on steady progress
through simple, repeatable actions.

> **LATTÉ** — *Little Actions Toward Tangible Éndings*

No dashboards.  
No notifications.  
No productivity theater.

Just a quiet tool to keep track of what matters *next*.

## Philosophy

`latte` follows the Unix philosophy:

- Do one thing well
- Prefer composability over complexity
- Make the common case fast
- Stay out of the way

Tasks are treated as lightweight records — not projects, not plans, not promises.
You add work, finish work, and move on.

Progress happens *latte*, one small action at a time.
